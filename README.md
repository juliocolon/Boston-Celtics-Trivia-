## Challenges 

I encountered difficulty in writing the function which populates the next question in my questions array, thinking I had to utilize a loop instead of incrementing through the array once the next button is clicked. I also did not know about the disabled property of a button, which I wrote a function for in
in order to disable the choices once an incorrect or correct answer is chosen on the given question.
