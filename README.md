## Approach
Focused upon laying out the game interface in the DOM, working through each event and writing the appropriate function for each event in pragmatic fashion. 
Spent most time on my nextQuestion() function, which was my biggest challenge thinking through how to append the appropriate key/value pair to the object I was aiming to target in the DOM.

## Challenges 
Thinking through how to organize my data either using an array or a class/constructor. I chose an array with nested objects. 
Thinking through my nextQuestion() function and making it dynamic. 
Diasabling certain buttons, once a user made a choice on a given question. 

## Unsolved Problems 
- Add a :24 second clock that would give users :24 seconds to answer each question, else their incorrect answers would increment and they 
would be forced to move onto the next question. 
- Add some 2D animation. 
- Randomize the questions and answers. 
- Make the design responsive for mobile devices. 
- Add a home screen, where a user can choose to play NBA trivia for all 32 teams.
