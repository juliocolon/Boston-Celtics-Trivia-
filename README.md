# Game: Boston Celtics Trivia 
A README.mdfile with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

## Technogies 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

## Approach
Focused upon laying out the game interface in the DOM, working through each event and writing the appropriate function for each event in pragmatic fashion. 
Spent most time on my nextQuestion() function, which was my biggest challenge thinking through how to append the appropriate key/value pair to the object in the DOM. 

## Live Site Link 
This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://juliocolon.github.io/Boston-Celtics-Trivia-/).

## Challenges 
Thinking through how to organize my data either using an array or a class/constructor. I choose with an array with nested objects. 
Thinking through my nextQuestion() function and making it dynamic. 
Diasabling certain buttons, once a user made a choice on a given question. 

## Unsolved Problems 
I would like to add a :24 second clock that would give users :24 seconds to answer each question, else their incorrect answers would increment and they 
would be forced to move onto the next question. 

I would like to add some 2D animation. 

I would like to randomize the questions and answers.
